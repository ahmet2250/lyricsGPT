Sober

There's a shadow just behind me
Shrouding every step I take
Making every promise empty
Pointing every finger at me
Waiting like a stalking butler
Who upon the finger rests
Murder now the pattern, must we
Just because the son has come
[Pre-Chorus]
Jesus, won't you fucking whistle
Something but the past and done?
Jesus, won't you fucking whistle
Something but the past and done?

[Chorus]
Why can't we not be sober?
I just want to start this over
Why can't we drink forever?
I just want to start this over

[Verse 2]
I am just a worthless liar
I am just an imbecile
I will only complicate you
Trust in me and fall as well
I will find a center in you
I will chew it up and leave
I will work to elevate you
Just enough to bring you down

Mother Mary, won't you whisper
Something but the past and done?
Mother Mary, won't you whisper
Something but the past and done?

[Chorus]
Why can't we not be sober?
I just want to start this over
Why can't we sleep forever?
I just want to start this over

[Bridge]
I am just a worthless liar
I am just an imbecile
I will only complicate you
Trust in me and fall as well
I will find a center in you
I will chew it up and leave
Trust me, trust me, trust me, trust me, trust me

[Chorus]
Why can't we not be sober?
I just want to start things over
Why can't we sleep forever?
I just want to start this over
[Outro]
I want what I want
I want what I want
I want what I want
I want what I want

Black
Then
White are
All I see
In my infancy
Red and yellow then came to be
Reaching out to me
Lets me see

[Pre-Chorus]
As below so above and beyond I imagine
Drawn beyond the lines of reason
Push the envelope
Watch it bend

[Chorus 1]
Over thinking, over analyzing, separates the body from the mind
Withering my intuition, missing opportunities and I must

[Post Chorus]
Feed my will to feel my moment
Drawing way outside the lines

[Chorus 2]
Over thinking, over analyzing, separates the body from the mind
Withering my intuition, leaving opportunities behind

[Post-Chorus]
Feed my will to feel this moment
Urging me to cross the line
Reaching out to embrace the random
Reaching out to embrace whatever may come

[Bridge]
I embrace my desire to
I embrace my desire to
Feel the rhythm
To feel connected
Enough to step aside and
Weep like a widow
To feel inspired
To fathom the power
To witness the beauty
To bathe in the fountain
To swing on the spiral
To swing on the spiral
To swing on the spiral
Of our divinity and
Still be a human
[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
With my feet upon the ground
I lose myself between the sounds
And open wide to suck it in
I feel it move across my skin
I'm reaching up and reaching out
I'm reaching for the random or
Whatever will bewilder me
Whatever will bewilder me
And following our will and wind
We may just go where no one's been
We'll ride the spiral to the end
And may just go where no one's been
Spiral out, keep going
Spiral out, keep going
Spiral out, keep going
Spiral out, keep going

Forty Six & 2

Join in my—
Join in, my child, and listen
Digging through
My old numb shadow

[Verse 1]
My shadow's shedding skin
I've been picking scabs again
I'm down, digging through
My old muscles, looking for a clue

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I've been crawling on my belly
Clearing out what could've been
I've been wallowing in my own confused
And insecure delusions
For a piece to cross me over
Or a word to guide me in
I wanna feel the changes coming down
I wanna know what I've been hiding

[Chorus 1]
In my shadow
My shadow
Change is coming through
My shadow
My shadow
Shedding skin
I've been picking
My scabs again

Clearing out what could've been

Insecure delusions
I wanna feel the change consume me
Feel the outside turning in
I wanna feel the metamorphosis and
Cleansing I've endured in

[Chorus 2]
My shadow
My shadow
Change is coming
Now is my time
Listen to my muscle memory
Contemplate what I've been clinging to
Forty-six and two ahead of me

[Bridge]
I choose to live and to grow
Take and give and to move
Learn and love and to cry
Kill and die and to be
Paranoid and to lie
Hate and fear and to do
What it takes to move through
I choose to live and to lie
Kill and give and to die
Learn and love and to do
What it takes to step through
[Interlude]

[Outro]
See my shadow changing
Stretching up and over me
Soften this old armor
Hoping I can clear the way by
Stepping through my shadow
Coming out the other side
Step into the shadow
Forty six and two are just ahead of me

Some say the end is near
Some say we'll see Armageddon soon
Certainly hope we will
I sure could use a vacation from
This bullshit three ring circus sideshow

Of freaks here in this hopeless fucking hole we call L.A.  
The only way to fix it is to flush it all away

The Pot

Who are you to wave your finger?
You must've been out your head
Eye hole deep in muddy waters
You practically raised the dead
Rob the grave to snow the cradle
Then burn the evidence down
Soapbox house of cards and glass so
Don't go tossin' your stones around
You must've been high
You must've been high
You must've been

[Bridge 1]
Foot in mouth and head up ass
So whatcha talkin' 'bout?
Difficult to dance 'round this one
'Til you pull it out, boy
You must've been so high
You must've been so high

[Verse 2]
Steal, borrow, refer, save your shady inference
Kangaroo done hung the juror with the innocent
Now you're weepin' shades of cozened indigo
Got lemon juice up in your eye
When you pissed all over my black kettle
You must've been high, high
You must've been high, high

Got lemon juice up in your eye, eye
When you pissed all over my black kettle

[Bridge 2]
So who are you to wave your finger?
Who are you to wave your fatty fingers at me?
You must have been out your mind
Weepin' shades of indigo
Shed without a reason
Weepin' shades of indigo

[Verse 4]
Liar, lawyer, mirror for ya, what's the difference?
Kangaroo be stoned, he's guilty as the government
Now you're weepin' shades of cozened indigo
Got lemon juice up in your eye, eye
Now when you pissed all over my black kettle
You must've been high, high, high, high

Schism

I know the pieces fit
'Cause I watched them fall away
Mildewed and smoldering
Fundamental differing
Pure intention juxtaposed
Will set two lovers' souls in motion
Disintegrating as it goes
Testing our communication

[Bridge]
The light that fueled our fire then
Has burned a hole between us so
We cannot seem to reach an end
Crippling our communication

[Verse 2]
I know the pieces fit
'Cause I watched them tumble down
No fault, none to blame
It doesn't mean I don't desire
To point the finger, blame the other
Watch the temple topple over
To bring the pieces back together
Rediscover communication
You might also like[Bridge]
The poetry that comes from
The squaring off between
And the circling is worth it
Finding beauty in the dissonance

[Verse 3]
There was a time that the pieces fit
But I watched them fall away
Mildewed and smoldering
Strangled by our coveting
I've done the math enough to know
The dangers of our second-guessing
Doomed to crumble unless we grow
And strengthen our communication

[Bridge]
Cold silence has a tendency to
Atrophy any sense of compassion
Between supposed lovers
Between supposed lovers

[Outro]
I know the pieces fit
I know the pieces fit
I know the pieces fit
I know the pieces fit
I know the pieces fit
I know the pieces fit
I know the pieces fit
And I know the pieces fit

Fear Inoculum

Immunity, long overdue
Contagion, I exhale you
Naive, I opened up to you
Venom and mania
Now, contagion, I exhale you

[Interlude]
The deceiver says, he says
"You belong to me
You don't wanna breathe the light of the others
Fear the light, fear the breath
Fear the others for eternity"
But I hear them now, inhale the clarity
Hear the venom, the venom in
What you say inoculated
Bless this immunity
Bless this immunity
Bless this immunity

[Chorus]
Exhale, expel
Recast my tale
Weave my allegorical elegy

[Verse 2]
Enumerate all that I'm to do
Calculating steps away from you
My own mitosis
Growing through division from mania

Exhale, expel
Recast my tale
Weave my allegorical elegy

Forfeit all control
You poison, you spectacle
Exorcise the spectacle
Exorcise the malady
Exorcise the disparate
Poison for eternity
Purge me and evacuate
The venom and the fear that binds me

Your veil now, lift away
I see you runnin'
Deceiver chased away
A long time comin'

10,000 Days (Wings Pt 2)

We listen to the tales and romanticize
How we'd follow the path of the hero
Boast about the day when the rivers overrun
How we rise to the height of our halo
Listen to the tales as we all rationalize
Our way into the arms of the savior
Feigning all the trials and the tribulations
None of us have actually been there
Not like you

[Verse 2]
Ignorant siblings at the congregation
Gather around spewing sympathy
Spare me
None of them can even hold a candle up to you
Blinded by choice, these hypocrites won't see
But enough about the collective Judas
Who could deny you were the one who
Illuminated your little piece of the divine?
And this little light of mine, a gift you passed on to me
I'm gonna let it shine to guide you safely on your way
Your way home

[Verse 3]
Oh, what are they gonna do when the lights go down
Without you to guide them all to Zion?
What are they gonna do when the rivers overrun
Other than tremble incessantly?
High is the way, but all eyes are upon the ground
You were the light and the way they'll only read about
I only pray Heaven knows when to lift you out
Ten thousand days in the fire is long enough
You're going home
You might also like[Chorus]
You're the only one who can hold your head up high
Shake your fists at the gates, saying
"I have come home now
Fetch me the spirit, the son, and the father
Tell them their pillar of faith has ascended
It's time now, my time now
Give me my, give me my wings"

[Post-Chorus]
Give me my
Give me my
Give me my
Give me my
Give me my
Give me my wings
You are the light and way that they will only read about

[Bridge]
Set as I am in my ways and my arrogance
Burden of proof tossed upon non-believers
You were my witness, my eyes, my evidence
Judith Marie, unconditional one

[Outro]
Daylight dims leaving cold fluorescence
Difficult to see you in this light
Please forgive this bold suggestion
Should you see your maker's face tonight
Look him in the eye, look him in the eye, and tell him
"I never lived a lie, never took a life, but surely saved one
Hallelujah, it's time for you to bring me home."

Stinkfist

Something has to change
Undeniable dilemma
Boredom's not a burden
Anyone should bear
Constant over-stimulation numbs me
But I would not want you any other way

[Chorus]
Just not enough
I need more
Nothing seems to satisfy
I said I don't want it
I just need it
To breathe, to feel, to know I'm alive

[Post-Chorus]
Finger deep within the borderline
Show me that you love me and that we belong together
Relax, turn around and take my hand

[Verse 2]
I can help you change
Tired moments into pleasure
Say the word and we'll be
Well upon our way
Blend and balance
Pain and comfort deep within you
'Til you will not want me any other way

This may hurt a little but it's something you'll get used to
Relax, slip away

Chupa minha pica bicha
Chupa minha pica bicha

[Bridge]
Something kinda sad about
The way that things have come to be
Desensitized to everything
What became of subtlety?
How can this mean anything to me
If I really don't feel anything at all?
I'll keep digging
'Til I feel something

Elbow deep inside the borderline
Show me that you love me and that we belong together
Shoulder deep within the borderline
Relax, turn around and take my hand

Rosetta Stoned

Alrighty, then
Picture this if you will

[Verse 1]
10 to 2 AM, X, Yogi DMT, and a box of Krispy Kremes
In my "need to know" pose, just outside of Area 51
Contemplating the whole "chosen people" thingy
When just then a flaming stealth banana split the sky
Like one would hope but never really expect to see in a place like this
Cutting right angle donuts on a dime
And stopping right at my Birkenstocks
And me yelping, "holy fucking shit"
Holy fucking shit
Holy fucking shit
Holy fucking shit
Holy fucking shit
Holy fucking shit
Holy fucking shit

[Verse 2]
Then the X-File being
Looking like some kind of blue-green Jackie Chan
With Isabella Rossellini lips, and breath that reeked of
Vanilla Chig Champa
Did a slow-mo Matrix descent
Outta the butt end of the banana vessel
And hovered above my bug-eyes, my gaping jaw
And my sweaty L. Ron Hubbard upper lip
And all I could think was
"I hope Uncle Martin here doesn't notice
That I pissed my fuckin' pants"
You might also like[Verse 3]
So light in his way, like an apparition, that
He had me crying out
"Fuck me, it's gotta be
The Deadhead Chemistry
The blotter got right on top of me
Got me seein' E-motherfuckin'-T"

[Verse 4]
And after calming me down
With some orange slices
And some fetal spooning
E.T. revealed to me his singular purpose
He said, "You are the chosen one
The one who will deliver the message
A message of hope for those who choose to hear it
And a warning for those who do not"
Me, the chosen one
They chose me
And I didn't even graduate from fuckin' high school
[Refrain]
You'd better
You'd better
You'd better
You'd better listen
[Verse 5]
Then he looked right through me
With somniferous almond eyes
Don't even know what that means
Must remember to write it down
This is so real
Like the time Dave floated away
See, my heart is pounding
'Cause this shit never happens to me

[Verse 6]
I can't breathe right now
It was so real
Like I woke up in Wonderland
All sorta terrifying
I don't wanna be all alone
While I tell this story
And can anyone tell me why
You all sound like Peanuts parents?
Will I ever be coming down?
This is so real
Finally, it's my lucky day
See, my heart is racing
'Cause this shit never happens to me

[Verse 7]
I can't breathe right now
You believe me, don't you?
Please believe what I've just said
See the Dead ain't touring
And this wasn't all in my head
See, they took me by the hand
And invited me right in
Then they showed me something
I don't even know where to begin
[Chorus]
Strapped down to my bed
Feet cold and eyes red
I'm out of my head
Am I alive? Am I dead?
Can't remember what they said
God damn, shit the bed

[Bridge]
Overwhelmed as one would be, placed in my position
Such a heavy burden now to be the one
Born to bear and bring to all the details of our ending
To write it down for all the world to see
But I forgot my pen
Shit the bed again
Typical

[Chorus]
Strapped down to my bed
Feet cold and eyes red
I'm out of my head
Am I alive? Am I dead?
Sunkist and Sudafed
Gyroscopes and infrared
Won't help, I'm brain dead
Can't remember what they said
God damn, shit the bed

[Verse 8]
I can't remember what they said to me
Can't remember what they said to make me out to be the hero
Can't remember what they said
Bob help me
Can't remember what they said

[Outro]
Don't know, won't know
Don't know, won't know
Don't know, won't know
Don't know, won't know
Don't know, won't know
Don't know, won't know
Don't know, won't know
Don't know, won't know
Don't know, won't know
Don't know, won't know
Don't know, won't know
Don't know, won't know
God damn, shit the bed

Parabola

We barely remember
Who or what came before this precious moment
We are choosing to be here right now
Hold on, stay inside

[Pre-Chorus]

This body, this body holding me
Be my reminder here that I am not alone in

Embrace this moment, remember
We are eternal, all this pain is an illusion

Right in Two

Angels on the sideline
Puzzled and amused
Why did Father give these humans free will?
Now they're all confused

[Chorus 1]
Don't these talking monkeys know that Eden has enough to go around?
Plenty in this holy garden, silly monkeys
Where there's one you're bound to divide it
Right in two

[Verse 2]
Angels on the sideline
Baffled and confused
Father blessed them all with reason
And this is what they choose?
(This is what they choose)

Monkey killing monkey killing monkey over pieces of the ground
Silly monkeys, give them thumbs, they forge a blade
And where there's one they're bound to divide it
Right in two

[Bridge 1]
Cut and divide it all right in two
Cut and divide it all right in two
Cut and divide it all right in two
Cut and divide it all right in two

[Bridge 2]
Fight over the clouds, over wind, over sky and
Fight over life, over blood, over air and light
Over love, over sun, over another
Fight for the time, for the one, for the rise and

[Verse 3]
Angels on the sideline again
Benched along with patience and reason
Angels on the sideline again
Wondering where this tug of war will end
[Outro]
Cut and divide it all right in two
Cut and divide it all right in two
Cut and divide it all right in two
Right in two

The Grudge

Wear the grudge like a crown of negativity
Calculate what we will or will not tolerate
Desperate to control all and everything
Unable to forgive your scarlet lettermen

[Verse 1]
Clutch it like a cornerstone
Otherwise, it all comes down
Justify denials and
Grip 'em to the lonesome end
Clutch it like a cornerstone
Otherwise, it all comes down
Terrified of being wrong
Ultimatum prison cell

Saturn ascends
Choose one or ten
Hang on or be
Humbled again
Humbled again

Wear the grudge like a crown

Unable to forgive and sinking deeper
Defining, confining
Sinking deeper
Controlling, defining

[Chorus]
Saturn comes back around to show you everything
Lets you choose what you will not see and then
Drags you down like a stone or lifts you up again
Spits you out like a child, light and innocent
[Bridge]
Saturn comes back around
Lifts you up like a child
Or drags you down like a stone
To consume you 'til you
Choose to let this go
Choose to let this go

[Verse 4]
Give away the stone
Let the oceans take and transmutate
This cold and fated anchor
Give away the stone
Let the waters kiss and transmutate
These leaden grudges into gold

Let go, let go, let go, let go
Let go, let go, let go, let go

Hooker with a Penis

I met a boy wearing Vans, 501s
And a dope Beastie tee, nipple rings, new tattoos
That claimed that he was OGT
Back from '92, from the first EP
And in between sips of Coke
He told me that he thought we were sellin' out
Layin' down, suckin' up to the man

[Chorus]
Well now, I've got some advice for you, little buddy
Before you point your finger, you should know that I'm the man
I'm the man and you're the man and he's the man as well
So you can point that fuckin' finger up your ass

[Post-Chorus]
All you know about me is what I've sold ya, dumb fuck
I sold out long before you'd ever even heard my name
I sold my soul to make a record, dipshit
And then you bought one

[Chorus]
I've got some advice for you, little buddy
Before you point your finger, you should know that I'm the man
If I'm the fuckin' man, then you're the fuckin' man as well
So you can point that fuckin' finger up your ass

All you know about me is what I've sold ya, dumb fuck
I sold out long before you'd ever even heard my name
I sold my soul to make a record, dipshit
And then you bought one

[Outro]
All you read and wear or see and hear on TV
Is a product begging for your fat-ass, dirty dollar
Shut up and buy, buy, buy my new record
And buy, buy, buy, send more money
Fuck you, buddy
Fuck you, buddy
Fuck you, buddy
Fuck you, buddy

Vicarious

Eye on the TV, 'cause tragedy thrills me
Whatever flavor it happens to be like
"Killed by the husband"
"Drowned by the ocean"
"Shot by his own son"
"She used a poison in his tea
Then kissed him goodbye"
That's my kind of story
It's no fun 'til someone dies
Don't look at me like I am a monster
Frown out your one face, but with the other
Stare like a junkie into the TV
Stare like a zombie while the mother holds her child
Watches him die
Hands to the sky cryin', "Why, oh why?"

[Chorus]
'Cause I need to watch things die
From a distance
Vicariously, I live while the whole world dies
You all need it too, don't lie

[Verse 2]
Why can't we just admit it?
Why can't we just admit it?
We won't give pause until the blood is flowin'
Neither the brave nor bold
Nor brightest of stories told
We won't give pause until the blood is flowin'
You might also like[Chorus]
I need to watch things die
From a good safe distance
Vicariously, I live while the whole world dies
You all feel the same, so
Why can't we just admit it?

[Bridge]
Blood like rain come down
Drum on grave and ground
Part vampire, part warrior
Carnivore and voyeur
Stare at the transmittal
Sing to the death rattle
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-lie
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-lie
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-lie
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-lie

[Verse 3]
Credulous at best, your desire to believe in
Angels in the hearts of men
Pull your head on out your hippie haze and give a listen
Shouldn't have to say it all again
The universe is hostile, so impersonal
Devour to survive, so it is, so it's always been
[Outro]
We all feed on tragedy
It's like blood to a vampire
Vicariously, I live while the whole world dies
Much better you than I

Third Eye

"See, I think drugs have done some good things for us, I really do. And if you don't believe drugs have done good things for us, do me a favor - go home tonight and take all your albums, all your tapes, and all your CDs and burn 'em. 'Cause you know what? The musicians who've made all that great music that's enhanced your lives throughout the years... real fucking high on drugs."

"Today a young man on acid realized that all matter is merely energy condensed to a slow vibration. That we are all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively. There is no such thing as death, life is only a dream, and we are the imagination of ourselves. Here's Tom with the weather."
"It's not a war on drugs, it's a war on personal freedom, that's what it is, okay? Keep that in mind at all times, thank you."

[Verse 1]
Dreaming of that face again
It's bright and blue and shimmering
Grinning wide
And comforting me with its three warm and wild eyes

[Verse 2]
On my back and tumbling
Down that hole and back again (And back again)
Rising up
And wiping the webs and the dew from my withered eye

[Refrain]
In, out, in, out, in, out

[Verse 3]
A child's rhyme stuck in my head
It said that life is but a dream
I've spent so many years in question
To find I've known this all along
You might also like[Chorus]
So good to see you
I've missed you so much
So glad it's over
I've missed you so much
Came out to watch you play
Why are you running away?
Came out to watch you play
Why are you running?

[Verse 4]
Shrouding all the ground around me
Is this holy crow above me
Black as holes within a memory
And blue as our new second sun
I stick my hand into the shadow
To pull the pieces from the sand
Which I attempt to reassemble
To see just who I might have been
I do not recognize the vessel
But the eyes seem so familiar
Like phosphorescent desert buttons
Singing one familiar song

[Chorus]
So good to see you
I've missed you so much
So glad it's over
I've missed you so much
Came out to watch you play
Why are you running away?
Came out to watch you play
Why are you running away?
[Refrain]
Prying open my third eye
Prying open my third eye
Prying open my third eye
Prying open my third eye

[Chorus]
So good to see you once again
I thought that you were hiding
And you thought that I had run away
Chasing the tail of dogma

[Refrain]
I opened my eye, I opened my eye
I opened my eye and there we were
I opened my eye, I opened my eye
I opened my eye and there we were

[Chorus]
So good to see you once again
I thought that you were hiding from me
And you thought that I had run away
Chasing a trail of smoke and reason

[Outro]
Prying open my third eye
Prying open my third eye
Prying open my third eye
Prying open my third eye
Prying open my third eye
Prying open my third eye
Prying open my third eye
Prying open my third eye
Prying open my third eye
Prying open my third eye

Prison Sex

It took so long to remember just what happened
I was so young and vestal then
You know it hurt me
But I'm breathing so I guess I'm still alive
Even if signs seem to tell me otherwise
Got my hands bound
And my head down and my eyes closed
My throat's wide open

[Refrain]
Do unto others what has been done to me
Do unto others what has been done to you

[Verse 2]
I'm treading water
I need to sleep a while
My lamb and martyr, you look so precious
Won't you, won't you come on a bit closer?
Close enough so I can smell you
I need you to feel this
I can't stand to burn too long
Release in sodomy
For one sweet moment I am whole

[Refrain]
Do unto you now what has been done to me

I need this to make me whole
Release in sodomy
Have you witnessed that blood and flesh can't be trusted?
Have you witnessed that blood and flesh can't be trusted?
And only this one holy medium brings me peace of mind

[Verse 4]
Got your hands bound
And your head down
And your eyes closed
You look so precious now

[Bridge]
I have found some kind of temporary sanity in this
Shit, blood, and cum on my hands
I've come 'round full circle

[Outro]
My lamb and martyr, this will be over soon
You look so precious, you look so precious
You look so precious, you look so precious
You look so precious now
You look so precious

Jambi

Here from the king's mountain view
Here from the wild dream come true
Feast like a sultan, I do
On treasures and flesh never few

[Chorus]
But I, I would wish it all away
If I thought I'd lose you just one day

[Verse 2]
The devil and his had me down
In love with the dark side I'd found
Dabblin' all the way down
Up to my neck, soon to drown
But you changed that all for me
Lifted me up, turned me 'round

[Chorus]
So I, I, I, I
I would, I would, I would wish this all away

[Verse 3]
Prayed like a martyr dusk to dawn
Begged like a hooker all night long
Tempted the devil with my song
And got what I wanted all along

But I, I would
If I could, then I would
Wish it away, wish it away
Wish it all away
Wanna wish it all away
No prize that could hold sway
Or justify my giving away my center

[Verse 4]
So if I could I'd wish it all away
If I thought tomorrow would take you away
You, my peace of mind, my all, my center
Just tryin' to hold on one more day
Damn my eyes, damn my eyes
Damn my eyes if they should compromise the fulcrum
If wants and needs divide me, then I might as well be gone

[Instrumental]

[Bridge]
Shine on forever
Shine on benevolent sun
Shine down upon the broken
Shine until the two become one
Shine on forever
Shine on benevolent sun
Shine down upon the severed
Shine until the two become one
Divided, withering away
Divided, withering away
Shine down upon the many
Light our way, benevolent sun
[Outro]
Breathe in union, breathe in union
Breathe in union, breathe in union
Breathe in union, so as one, survive
Another day and season
Silence, legion, save your poison
Silence, legion, stay out of my way

Eulogy

He had a lot of nothing to say, we'll miss him
We'll miss him
He had a lot to say
He had a lot of nothing to say, we'll miss him
We'll miss him
We're gonna miss him
We're gonna miss him
So long
We wish you well
You told us how you weren't afraid to die
Well, so long
Don't cry
Or feel too down
Not all martyrs see divinity
But at least you tried

Standing above the crowd
He had a voice that was strong and loud, we'll miss him
We'll miss him
Ranting and pointing his finger
At everything but his heart, we'll miss him
We'll miss him
We're gonna miss him
We're gonna miss him
You might also likeYeah, no way, yeah
To recall
What it was that you had said to me
Like I care at all
But it was so loud
And you sure could yell
You took a stand on every little thing
And it was so loud

You could be the one who saves me from my own existence
Warn while some child might chill, nine-one-two
I'm too smart when you're invisible by the bone symbol on you
So he bashes his skull through the window while looking out to the sea
Like torment of my ego
And we're amused by this

Yeah, standing above the crowd
He had a voice that was strong and loud and I
Swallowed his facade 'cause I'm so
Eager to identify with
Someone above the ground
Someone who seemed to feel the same
Someone prepared to lead the way, and
Someone who would die for me
Will you?
Will you now?
Would you die for me?
Don't you fuckin' lie
Don't you step out of line
Don't you step out of line
Don't you step out of line
Don't you fuckin' lie

You've claimed all this time that you would die for me
Why then are you so surprised when you hear your own eulogy?

He had a lot to say
He had a lot of nothing to say
He had a lot to say
He had a lot of nothing to say

Come down
Get off your fuckin' cross
We need the fuckin' space
To nail the next fool martyr

To ascend you must die
You must be crucified
For our sins and our lies
Goodbye

H.

What's coming through is alive
What's holding up is a mirror
But what's singing songs is a snake, it is
Lookin' to turn my piss to wine
They're both totally void of hate, and
Killin' me just the same

[Refrain]
The snake behind me hisses
What my damage could have been
My blood before me begs me
Open up my heart again
And I feel this coming over like a storm again
Considerately

[Verse 2]
Venomous voice, tempts me
And drains me, bleeds me
Leaves me cracked and empty
Drags me down like some sweet gravity

[Refrain]
The snake behind me hisses
What my damage could have been
My blood before me begs me
Open up my heart again
And I feel this coming over like a storm again, now
And I feel this coming over like a storm again, now

[Verse 3]
Without the skin, here
Beneath the storm
Under these tears, now
The walls came down
Once the snake is drowned
And as I look in his eyes
My fear begins to fade
Recalling all of the times
I could have cried then
I should have cried then
As the walls come down and
As I look in your eyes
My fear begins to fade
Recalling all of the times
I have died
And will die
It's alright
[Pre-Chorus]
I don't mind
I don't mind
I don't mind

To slip away and fade away
Days away, I still feel you
Touching me, changing me

Keep, keep
Keep, keep, keep it calm
Keep, keep calm
Keep, keep it, keep it calm
Keep, keep calm
Keep, keep, keep calm
Fuck, here we go again

[Verse 1]
Heat lightning flash, but don't blink
Misleading, tranquility ruse
You're gonna happen again
That's what I think
Follow the evidence
Look it dead in the eye, you are darkness
Trying to lull us in, before the havoc begins
Into a dubious state of serenity
Acting all surprised when you're caught in the lie
We know better
It's not unlike you
It's not unlike you
We know your nature

[Verse 2]
Blame it all on the bastards when you're blowing out
Shame on you, shame on you now
No amount of wind could begin to cover up
Your petulant stench and demeanor
Calm as cookies and cream, so it seems
We're not buying your dubious state of serenity
Acting all surprised when you're caught in the lie
We know better
It's not unlike you
It's not unlike you
We know your nature

A tempest must be just that
A tempest must be just that

[Verse 4]
Control your delusion
Insane and striking at random
Victim of your certainty
And therefore, your doubt's not an option
Blameless, the tempest will be just that
So try as you may, feeble, your attempt to atone
Your words to erase all the damage cannot

Descending

Free fall through our midnight
This epilogue of our own fable
Heedless in our slumber
Floating nescient, we

Free fall through this boundlessness
This madness of our own making
Falling isn't flying
Floating isn't infinite

Come, our end, suddenly
All hail our lethargy
Concede suddenly

To the quickened dissolution
Pray we mitigate the ruin

Pushit

I saw the gap again today
While you were begging me to stay
Take care not to make me enter
If I do, we both may disappear

[Verse 1]
Know that I will choke until I swallow
Choke this infant here before me
What is this but my reflection?
Who am I to judge or strike you down?

[Chorus]
But you're
Pushing and shoving me
Pushing and shoving me
Pushing and shoving me
Pushing and shoving me
Pushing and shoving me
Pushing and shoving me
Pushing and shoving me
Pushing and shoving me

But you didn't need to push it on me

[Verse 3]
I'm slipping back into the gap again
I'm alive when you're touching me
Alive when you're shoving me down, yeah
But I'd trade it all
For just a little peace of mind

[Chorus]
Push it on me, push it on me
Push it on me, push it on me
You're pushing, and shoving, and scrambling
To keep my feet flat on the ground
[Bridge]
I am somewhere I don't wanna be, yeah
Push me somewhere I don't wanna be
You put me somewhere I don't wanna be
Seeing someplace I don't wanna see
Never want to see that place again

[Verse 4]
Saw that gap again today
While you were begging me to stay
Managed to push myself away
And you, as well, my dear
And if when I say I might fade like a sigh if I stay
You minimize my movement anyway
I must persuade you another way

[Outro]
Pushing and shoving
Pushing and shoving
Pushing me
There's no love in fear
Yeah, I'm staring down the hole again
Hands around my back again
Survival is my only friend
Terrified of what may come, yeah
Remember I'll always love you
As I claw your fucking throat away
It will end no other way
It will end no other way

The Patient

A groan of tedium escapes me
Startling the fearful
Is this a test? It has to be
Otherwise, I can't go on
Draining patience, drain vitality
This paranoid, paralyzed vampire act's a little old

[Verse 2]
But I'm still right here
Giving blood, keeping faith
And I'm still right here
But I'm still right here
Giving blood, keeping faith
And I'm still right here

[Pre Chorus]
Wait it out
Gonna wait it out
Wait it out (Be patient)

No loving embrace to see me through

Reflection

I have come curiously close to the end, though
Beneath my self-indulgent pitiful hole
Defeated
I concede and move closer
I may find comfort here
I may find peace within the emptiness
How pitiful
It's calling me (Calling me)
It's calling me (Calling me)
It's calling me (Calling me)
It's calling me

[Verse 2]
And in my darkest moment, fetal and weeping
The moon tells me a secret, a confidant
As full and bright as I am
This light is not my own and
A million light reflections pass over me
The source is bright and endless
She resuscitates the hopeless
Without her, we are lifeless satellites drifting
And as I pull my head out, I am without one doubt
Don't want to be down here soothing my narcissism, I
Must crucify the ego before it's far too late
I pray the light lifts me out

So crucify the ego, before it's far too late
And leave behind this place so negative and blind and cynical
And you will come to find that we are all one mind
Capable of all that's imagined and all conceivable
So let the light touch you so that the words spill through
And let the past break through, bringing out our hope and reason

Before we pine away (Pine away)
Before we pine away (Pine away)
Before we pine away (Pine away)

Wings for Marie (Pt 1)

You
You believed
You believed in movements none could see
You believed in me

[Verse 1]
A passionate spirit
Uncompromised
Boundless and open
A light in your eyes
Then immobilized

[Refrain]
Broken, broken
Fell at the hands of those movements that I wouldn't see
Yet it was you who prayed for me
So what have I done
To be a son to an angel?
What have I done
To be worthy?

[Interlude]

[Outro]
Daylight dims leaving cold fluorescents
Difficult to see you in this light
Please forgive this selfish question, but
What am I to say to all these ghouls tonight?
"She never told a lie, well, might have told a lie
But never lived one
Didn't have a life, didn't have a life
But surely saved one"
See? I'm alright
Now it's time for us to let you goYou might also like

What was it like to see
The face of your own stability
Suddenly look away
Leaving you with the dead and hopeless?
Eleven and she was gone
Eleven is when we waved goodbye
Eleven is standing still (Waiting for me)
Waiting for me to free him by
Coming home

[Verse 2]
Moving me with a sound
Opening me within a gesture
Drawing me down and in
(Showing me where it all began)
Showing me where it all began
Eleven
He was too scarred to realize
You were the voice that's been calling me back home

[Verse 3]
Under a dead Ohio sky
Eleven has been and will be waiting
Defending his light and wondering
Where the hell have I been?
Sleeping lost and numb, I'm

High

[Verse 4]
Hold your light, Eleven
Lead me through each gentle step, by step
By inch by loaded memory, I'll move to heal
As soon as pain allows so we can
Reunite and both move on together
Hold your light, Eleven
Lead me through each gentle step, by step
By inch by loaded memory until
One and one are one, eleven
So glow, child, glow

Choosing to be here right now
Hold on, stay inside

Bottom

Compassion is broken now
My will is eroded now
Desire is broken now
It makes me feel ugly

[Chorus: Maynard James Keenan]
On my knees and burning
My piss and moans are fuelling
I set my head on fire
Smell my soul is burning

[Verse 2: Maynard James Keenan]
I'm broken, looking up to see the enemy
And I have swallowed the poison you feed me
But I survive on the poison you feed me, leaving me
Guilt-fed, hatred-fed, weakness-fed
It makes me feel ugly

Jesus Christ, why don't you come save my life now?
Open my eyes, blind me with your light now

If you want to get your soul to Heaven
Trust in me, now don't you judge or question
You are broken now, but faith can heal you
Just do everything I tell you to do

[Chorus]
Jesus Christ, why don't you come save my life now?
Open my eyes, blind me with your light now
Jesus Christ, why don't you come save my life now?
Open my eyes, blind me with your light now
Deaf and blind and dumb and born to follow
Let me lay my holy hand up, hand upon you

[Post-Chorus]
My God's will
Becomes me
When he speaks
He speaks through me
He has needs
Like I do
We both want
To rape you
[Part II: The Gaping Lotus Experience]

[Verse 1]
I had a friend once, he took some acid
Now he thinks he's a fire engine
It's okay until he pisses on your lighter
Kinda smells, kinda cool, kinda funny anyway

[Refrain]
Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan

[Verse 2]
I had a friend once, he took some ecstasy
Tried to marry me and every one in the room
He was sort of loving, kinda caring
Kinda tried to fuck my La-Z-Boy
It got a bit messy all over the curtains
Arm chair covers, throw pillows, and carpeting

I'm getting bored, I'm getting bored
I'm getting bored, I'm getting bored

Without evidence
Only the whispers from within

Message to Harry Manback

Hmm? You think you're cool, right? Hmm? Hmm?
When you kicked out people out of the house.
I tell you this, one of three Americans is dying out of cancer.
You know? Asshole. You're gonna be one of those.
I didn't have the courage to kick your ass directly.
Don't have enough courage for that.
I could, you know?
You know you're gonna have another accident?
You know I'm involved with black magic?
Fuck you. Die. Bastard.
You think you're so cool, hmm? Asshole.
And if I ever see your fucking face around, in Europe or Italy
Well, I'll—that time I'm gonna kick your ass.
Fuck you. Fucking Americans. Yankee.
You're gonna die outta cancer, I promise.
Deep pain. No one did what you did to me.
You wanna know something? Fuck you.

Pezzo di merda, figlio di puttana.
I hope somebody in your family dies soon.

Undertow

Two times in
I've been struck dumb by a voice that
Speaks from deep beneath peerless water that's
Twice as clear as heaven
Twice as loud as reason
Deep and rich like silt on a riverbed
Just as never ending
Current's mouth below me
Opens up around me
Suggests and beckons all while swallowing
Surrounds and drowns and wipes me away
But I'm so comfortable, so comfortable

[Chorus]
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up
You're saturating me
How could I let this bring me
Back to my knees?

[Verse 2]
Third time in
I've been baptized by your voice that
Screams from deep beneath the cold black water that's
Half as high as heaven
Half as clear as reason
Cold and black like silt on the riverbed
Just as never ending
Current's mouth below me
Opens up around me
Suggests and beckons all while swallowing
Surrounds and drowns and wipes me away

Disgustipated

And the angel of the lord came unto me, snatching me up from my place of slumber, and took me on high, and higher still until we moved to the spaces betwixt the air itself. And he brought me into a vast farmland of our own Midwest. And as we descended, cries of impending doom rose from the soil. One thousand, nay, a million voices full of fear. And terror possessed me then. And I begged, "Angel of the Lord, what are these tortured screams?"
And the angel said unto me, "These are the cries of the carrots. The cries of the carrots. You see, Reverend Maynard, tomorrow is harvest day and to them it is the holocaust". And I sprang from my slumber drenched in sweat like the tears of one million terrified brothers and roared, "Hear me now, I have seen the light! They have a consciousness, they have a life, they have a soul! Damn you! Let the rabbits wear glasses! Save our brothers!" Can I get an amen? Can I get a hallelujah? Thank you, Jesus

[Spoken Outro]
It was daylight when you woke up in your ditch. You looked up at your sky. Then, that made blue be your color. You had your knife there with you too. When you stood up there was goo all over your clothes. Your hands were sticky. You wiped them on your grass, so now your color was green. Oh Lord, why did everything always have to keep changing like this? You were already getting nervous again. Your head hurt and it rang when you stood up. Your head was almost empty. It always hurt you when you woke up like this. You crawled up out of your ditch onto your gravel road and began to walk, waiting for the rest of your mind to come back to you. You can see the car parked far down the road and you walked toward it. "If God is our father," you thought, "then Satan must be our cousin." Why didn't anyone else understand these important things? You got to your car and tried all the doors. They were locked. It was a red car and it was new. There was an expensive leather camera case laying on the seat. Out across your field, you could see two tiny people walking by your woods. You began to walk towards them. Now red was your color, and of course, those little people out there were yours too

Pushit (Live)

We've been, we've been trying something
A little different this tour
We've been looking at one of our songs
From a different angle, under a different light
So we can hopefully kind of
See it almost for the first time
We'd like to try that for you tonight, is that okay?
We're gonna need your help though
We need your help and your permission
So we need you to find a comfortable space
That's not only comfortable, but vulnerable
And to just shut your eyes and go there
And we'll meet you on the other side...

[Intro]
I saw the gap again today
While you were begging me to stay
Take care not to make me enter
If I do we both may disappear
If I do we both may disappear
I saw the gap again today
While you were begging me to stay
Managed to push myself away
And you as well, my dear
And you as well
Pushed you away, my dear
Pushed you away
Pushed you away
Pushed you away, my dear
You might also like[Verse 1]
I will choke until I swallow
Choke this infant here before me
What are you but my reflection?
Who am I to judge or strike you down?
Who am I to judge or strike you down?

[Refrain]
But you're pushing, and I'm shoving you
And you're pushing me, and I'm shoving you

[Verse 2]
Rest your trigger on my finger
Bang my head upon the fault line
You'd better take care not to make me enter
If I do we both may disappear
If I do we both may disappear

[Refrain]
But you're pushing, and I'm shoving you
And you're pushing me, and I'm shoving you

[Chorus]
You still love me, you still love me
You still love me, you still love me
You're pushing, and we're shoving
And we're pushing, and I'm shoving
And you still love me, you still love me
You still love me, you still love me
You're pushing, and we're shoving
And I'm pushing, and you're shoving me
[Verse 3]
And I'm slipping back into
The gap again
I feel alive when you touch me
I feel alive when you hold me
Down
Slipping back into
Slipping back into

[Bridge]
I am somewhere I don't wanna be, yeah
Put me somewhere I don't wanna be
Push me somewhere I don't wanna be
Seeing someplace I don't wanna see
Never wanna see that place again

[Verse 4]
I saw the gap again today
While you were begging me to stay
Managed to push myself away
And you as well, my dear
If when I say I might fade like a sigh if I stay
You minimize my movement anyway
I must persuade you another way
Pushing and shoving
And pushing and shoving
And pushing me
There's no love in fear
[Outro]
Staring down the hole again
Hands are on my back again
Survival is my only friend
Terrified of what may come
Remember I'll always love you
As I claw your fucking throat away
It will end no other way
It will end no other way

----------------------------------------------

You Lied (Live)


[Chorus]
Setting sun can't shine, now you're gone
Inside sleeping, my heart beating
You know that you tried to hide it
Shouldn't you have said what you meant? Oh..

[Verse]
Time heals, time congeals around us
Endless hours of wasted moments
Understanding, not demanding
Your eyes tell what you feel inside

[Chorus]
Setting sun can't shine, now you're gone
Inside sleeping, my heart beating
You know that you tried to hide it
Shouldn't you have said what you meant?

Sober (Live)

Shrouding every step I take
Making every promise empty
Pointing every finger at me
Waiting like a stalking butler
Who upon the finger rests
Murder now the path called "must we"
Just before the son has come

Jesus won't you whistle
Something but the past and done?

Why can't we drink forever

Third Eye (Live)

Think for yourself, question authority
Think for yourself, question authority
Throughout human history, as our species has faced the frightening, terrorizing fact that we do not know who we are, or where we're going in this ocean of chaos, it has been the authorities, the political, the religious, the educational authorities Who attempted to comfort us by giving us order, rules, regulations, informing, forming in our minds their view of reality
To think for yourself you must question authority and learn how to put yourself in a state of vulnerable, open-mindedness;
Chaotic, confused, vulnerability to inform yourself
Think for yourself, question authority
Think for yourself, question authority
Think for yourself, question authority
Think for yourself
Think for yourself
Order, regulations, rules
Think for yourself, question authority
Order, regulations, rules, comfort us

[Verse 1]
Dreaming of that face again
It's bright and blue and shimmering
Grinning wide
And comforting me with its three warm and wild eyes

[Verse 2]
On my back and tumbling
Down that hole and back again (And back again)
Rising up
And wiping the webs and the dew from my withered eye

[Verse 3]
A child's rhyme stuck in my head
It said that life is but a dream
I've spent so many years in question
To find I've known this all along

[Chorus 1]
So good to see you
I've missed you so much
So glad it's over
I've missed you so much
Came out to watch you play
Why are you running away?
Came out to watch you play
Why are you running?
[Bridge]
Shrouding all the ground around me
Is this holy crow above me
Black as holes within a memory
Blue as our new second sun
I stick my hand into the shadow
Pull the pieces from the sand
Try to attempt to reassemble
See just who I might have been
I do not recognize the vessel
But the eyes seem so familiar
Like phosphorescent desert buttons
Singing one familiar song

[Chorus 1]
So good to see you
I've missed you so much
So glad it's over
I've missed you so much
Came out to watch you play
Why you running away?
Came out to watch you play
Why you running away?

So good to see you once again
I thought that you were hiding
And you thought that I had run away
Chasing the tail of dogma

[Pre-Chorus]
I opened my eye, I opened my eye
I opened my eye and there we were
I opened my eye, I opened my eye
I opened my eye and there we were

[Chorus 2]
So good to see you once again
I thought that you were hiding from me
And you thought that I had run away
Chasing a trail of smoke and reason

Demon Cleaner

I've got the demons within
I've got to brush them all away
I feel the demon's rage
I must clean them all away
Excite to scream them away

That magic cleaner oh
Shine his smile on me
I am the demon
Cleaner who saves the day
I get the back ones
And important they'll always stay
If only one thing that you know

Oh don't you listen to them say

Revolution

Living on the street shores
He didn't learn and wanted children
Said, "What is there left to stay alive for?"

Here they come, feelings that come as natural
Whatever left, he considered a loss, you all
He doesn't want to see it

Running away, getting some kinda cure

Give him your love, give him your love to save him[x2]

Shit, fucking shit, fucking shit, fucking shit
Fucking shit, fucking shit, fucking shit, fucking shit, fucking-

One great big festering neon distraction
I've a suggestion to keep you all occupied
Swim, learn to swim, learn to swim, learn to swim
Learn to swim, learn to swim, learn to swim, learn to swim
Learn to-
Time to hit tidally, now
Mom's gonna flush it all away-away

[Verse 4]
Swim, learn to swim, learn to swim, learn to swim
Learn to swim, learn to swim, learn to swim, learn to swim, learn-
Fuck retro anything, fuck your tattoos
Fuck all you junkies, and fuck your short memory
Swim, learn to swim, learn to swim, learn to swim
Learn to swim, learn to swim, learn to swim, learn to swim, learn to-
Fuck L. Ron Hubbard, and fuck all his clones
Fuck all these gun-toting hip gangster wannabes
Swim, learn to swim, learn to swim, learn to swim
Learn to swim, learn to swim, learn to swim, learn to swim, learn to
Fuck smiley glad-hands with hidden agendas
Fuck these dysfunctional insecure actresses
Swim, learn to swim, learn to swim, learn to swim
Learn to swim, learn to swim, learn to swim, learn to swim
[Verse 5]
I watch it go right in, now
Wanna wash it all away, now
Wanna watch it go right down
Wanna watch it go away
Wanna see it go right in
Wanna wash it all away
Wanna wash it all away
Wanna wash it all a-way

[Verse 6]
Can it die again?
Can- in my head?
Time to make me start again, time and time
Yeah now, yeah-

[Instrumental outro]

[Outro]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

Crawl Away (Demo)

Crawled away from me
Slipped away from me
Tried to keep a hold
But there was nothing I could say
Slid away from me
Crept away from me
Tried to keep you down
But there was nothing I could say

[Chorus]
What you're trying to say
Is you don't wanna play
What you want and what you need
Don't mean that much to me
I can see your
Back is turning
If I could I'd
Stick a knife in

[Verse 2]

This is love

Flood (Live)

[00:29.36]Are crumbling images
That no longer comfort me
I scramble to reach higher ground
Some order and sanity
Or something to comfort me
So I take what is mine, and hold what is mine
Suffocate what is mine, and bury what's mine
Soon the water will come
And claim what is mine
I must leave it behind
And climb to a new place now

This ground is not the rock I thought it to be

Thought I was high, and free
I thought I was there
Divine destiny
I was wrong
This changes everything

Running away
Running away now
Running away
Running away now
Running away
So I take what is mine, and hold what is mine
Suffocatе what is mine, and bury what's mine
Soon the watеr will come
And claim what is mine
I must leave it behind
And climb to a new place now
You might also likeThe water is rising up on me, the water is rising up on me
Thought the sun would come deliver me
But the truth has come to punish me instead

The ground is breaking down right under me
Cleanse and purge me
In the water

Prison Sex (Radio Edit)

I was so young and vestal then
You know it hurt me
But I'm breathing so I guess I'm still alive
Even if signs seem to tell me otherwise
Got my hands bound and my head down and my eyes closed
My throat's wide open

Do unto others, what has been done to me
Do unto others, what has been done to you

I'm treading water
I need to sleep a while
My lamb and martyr
You look so precious won't you
Won't you come a bit, a bit closer
Close enough so I, I can smell you
I need you to feel this
I can't stand to burn too long
Release in sodomy
For one sweet moment I'm whole

Do unto you now, what has been done to me
Do unto you now, what has been done

You're breathing so I guess you're still alive
Even if signs seem to tell me otherwise
Won't you, won't you come on a bit closer
Close enough so I can smell you
I need you to feel this
I need this to make me whole
Release in sodomy
Have you witnessed that blood and flesh can't be trusted?
Have you witnessed that blood and flesh can't be trusted?
And only this one holy medium brings me piece of mind
You might also likeGot your hands bound
And your head down
And your eyes closed
You look so precious now

I have found some kind of temporary sanity in this
Shit, blood and cum on my hands

Come
'Round
Full circle

My lamb and martyr, this will be over soon
You look so precious, you look so precious
You look so precious, you look so precious
You look so precious now
You look so precious

To the icicle

Ayo, Cole Niswander, it's time
It's time, Cole Niswander (aight, Cole Niswander, begin)
Straight out the gay dungeons of rap

The addict drops deep as does my moose
I never game, 'cause to game is the daddy of use
Beyond the walls of tool fans, life is defined
I think of my testicles when I'm in a Cum-ville state of mind
Hope the juice got some use
My abuse don't like no dirty loose
Run up to the producе and get the goose

In a Cum-villе state of mind
What more could you ask for? The mexican addict?
You complain about your testicles
I gotta love it though - somebody still speaks for the derelict

I'm rappin' to the bicycle
And I'm gonna move your icicle

Filipino, greek, racist, like a monkey
Boy, I tell you, I thought you were a flunky
I can't take the your testicles, can't take the snake
I woulda tried to meme I guess I got no cake
You might also likeI'm rappin' to the icicle
And I'm gonna move your bicycle

Yea, yaz, in a Cum-ville state of mind

When I was young my daddy had a perfect
I waz kicked out without no strict
I never thought I'd see that convict
Ain't a soul alive that could take my daddy's conflict
A 6'4" cat is quite the mat
Thinking of my testicles. Yaz, thinking of my testicles (my testicles)

Sober (Album Version)

Shrouding every step I take
Making every promise empty
Pointing every finger at me
Waiting like a stalking butler
Who upon the finger rests
Murder now the path of must we
Just because the son has come

Jesus, won't you fucking whistle
Something but the past and done?
Jesus, won't you fucking whistle
Something but the past and done?

Why can't we not be sober?
Just want to start this over
And why can't we drink forever?
I just want to start this over

I am just a worthless liar
I am just an imbecile
I will only complicate you
Trust in me and fall as well
I will find a center in you
I will chew it up and leave
I will work to elevate you
Just enough to bring you down
You might also likeMother Mary, won't you whisper?
Something but what's past and done
Mother Mary, won't you whisper?

Why can't we not be sober?
I just want to start this over

I just want to start this over
Why?

I am just a worthless liar
I am just an imbecile
I will only complicate you
Trust in me and fall as well
I will find a center in you
I will chew it up and leave

Trust me

Why can't we not be sober?
I just want to start things over
And why can't we sleep forever?
I just want to start this over
Why?
I want what I want
I want what I want
I want what I want

Stinkfist Live

Undeniable dilemma
Boredom's not a burden
Anyone should bear
Constant over stimulation numbs me
But I would not want you any other way

Just not enough
I need more
Nothing seems to satisfy
I said
I don't want it
I just need it
To breathe, to feel, to know I'm alive

Finger deep within the borderline
Show me that you love me and that we belong together
Relax, turn around and take my hand

I can help you change
Tired moments into pleasure
Say the word and we'll be
Well upon our way
Blend and balance
Pain and comfort
Deep within you
'Til you will not want mе any other way
You might also likeBut
It's not enough
I need more
Nothing seems to satisfy
I said
I don't want it
I just need it
To brеathe, to feel, to know I'm alive

Knuckle deep inside the borderline
This may hurt a little but it's something you'll get used to
Relax, slip away

Chupa minha pica bicha
Chupa minha pica bicha
Chupa minha pica bicha

There's something kinda sad about
The way that things have come to be
Desensitized to everything
What became of subtlety?
How can this mean anything to me
If I really don't feel anything at all?
I'll keep digging
'Til I feel something
Elbow deep inside the borderline
Show me that you love me and that we belong together
Shoulder deep within the borderline
Relax, turn around and take my hand
